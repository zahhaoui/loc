<p><span class="head4">MECHANICAL REPAIRS AND ACCIDENTS</span><br> 10. If the vehicle is involved in an accident, is damaged, breaks down or requires repair or salvage, regardless of cause, the hirer shall notify the owner of the full circumstances by telephone immediately.<br> 11. The hirer shall not arrange or undertake any repairs or salvage without the owner's authority (this includes, but is not limited to, purchasing a replacement tyre) except to the extent that repairs or salvage are necessary to prevent further damage to the vehicle or to other property.<br> 12. 24 Hour Roadside Assistance is free for all inherent mechanical faults (as determined by the owner or its authorised repairer) related to the vehicle specified in the Rental Document. For all other roadside assistance call outs including refueling, jump start, tyre related incidents, lost keys and keys locked in the vehicle, a service fee will be charged.<br> 13. If the vehicle requires repair or replacement, the decision to supply another vehicle to the hirer is at the owner's sole discretion.</p>
<p><span class="head4">RETURN OF VEHICLE</span><br> 14. The hirer shall, at or before the expiry of the term of hire, deliver the vehicle to the agreed rental location described in the Rental Document or obtain the owner's consent to the continuation of the hire (in which case the hirer shall pay additional hire charges for the extended term of hire). If the hirer does not comply with this clause, and does not immediately return the vehicle, the owner may report the vehicle as stolen to the Police and the hirer must compensate the owner for either the full cost of the vehicle, or all additional costs and losses incurred up to the time that the vehicle is recovered by the owner.</p>
<p><span class="head4">LIABILITY</span><br> 15. The hirer is liable for:<br> a) any loss of, or damage to, the vehicle and its accessories;<br> b) any consequential damage, loss or costs incurred by the owner, including salvage costs, loss of ability to re-hire and loss of revenue; and<br> c) any loss of, or damage to, vehicles and property of third parties, arising during the term of hire.</p>
<p><span class="head4">INSURANCE</span><br> 16. The hirer is advised that motor vehicle insurance must be offered by the owner, but the hirer can make their own insurance arrangements, provided these are approved by the owner. If the owner is not satisfied that the hirer's insurance is comparable to the owner's, the owner may decline to hire the vehicle.<br> 17. If the hirer elects to use the owner's insurance, any driver named in the Rental Document as a person permitted to drive the vehicle is, subject to the damage administration fee in clause 21, the excess payable by the hirer as noted in clause 20 and the insurance exclusions set out in clause 22, covered against the losses set out in clause 15.<br> 18. The hirer's liability is covered by the owner's insurance as set out in clause 15, up to the value of $150,000 in respect of the above sub-clauses 15(a) and 15(b), and $5,000,000 in respect of sub-clause 15(c). This clause 18 does not apply if the hirer rejects the owner's insurance.<br> 19. If the hirer elects to use the owner's insurance, the insurance premium is included in the hire charge.<br> 20. If the hirer elects to use the owner's insurance, the excess payable by the hirer is as specified in the Rental Document and is payable for each and every incident involving the vehicle. If the damage is excluded under the owner's insurance, the excess will be considered part payment toward the total damage cost and any additional cost will be charged to the hirer in accord with clause 4.<br> 21. An additional Damage Administration fee of $75 plus GST will be applied for processing damage claims. This fee applies to all damage claims regardless of whether the hirer elects to use the owner's insurance or has their own insurance arrangements. This fee may be refunded if it is proven that the damage was not due to the hirer's fault.</p>
<p><span class="head4">INSURANCE EXCLUSIONS</span><br> 22. The hirer acknowledges that the cover referred to in clause 18 will not apply:<br> a) at any time when the driver of the vehicle is under the influence of alcohol or any drug;<br> b) at any time when the vehicle is in an unsafe or unroadworthy condition, such condition arising during the course of the hire, that caused or contributed to the damage or loss, and the hirer or driver was aware or should have been aware of the unsafe or unroadworthy condition of the vehicle;<br> c) at any time when a mechanical failure breakdown or breakage occurs and/or an electrical or electronic failure or breakdown occurs that is the result of improper use of the vehicle. This exclusion also applies to damage to the engine or transmission system directly resulting from any mechanical failure breakdown or breakage, but does not otherwise apply to resulting damage to other parts of the vehicle;<br> d) at any time when the vehicle is driven in any race, speed test, reliability trial, rally or contest, or operated on any race or rally circuit or in any event as a pace-maker, or testing in preparation for any of them;<br> e) at any time when the vehicle is driven by anyone not named or described in the Rental Document as a person permitted to drive the vehicle (unless the hirer is a body corporate or Department of State and the driver is authorised by them to drive, subject to all other terms and conditions in the Rental Agreement);<br> f) at any time when the vehicle is driven by an unlicensed person;<br> g) at any time when the vehicle is willfully or recklessly damaged or lost by the hirer, a nominated driver, or a person under the hirer's authority or control;<br> h) at any time when the driver commits a traffic offence while driving the vehicle;<br> i) at any time when the vehicle is loaded or is being loaded in excess of the manufacturer's specifications;<br> j) at any time when the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded beyond the limits of a thoroughfare and such loading or unloading is not performed by the driver or attendant of the vehicle;<br> k) at any time when the driver fails to stop or remain at the scene following the occurrence of an accident where required to do so by law;<br> l) to any fine or penalty imposed as a result of prosecution for breach of any law;<br> m) to any puncture, cut or bursting of any tyre, or damage to any tyre by application of brakes;<br> n) to any wear and tear to the vehicle;<br> o) to any liability for damage caused by vibration or the weight of the vehicle or its load to any: bridge or viaduct; any road or anything beneath a road; any underground pipe line or cable; or any other underground installation provided that the limit of liability in these circumstances will be $1,000,000;<br> p) to any overhead damage to the vehicle or to the property of any third party resulting from such overhead damage;<br> q) at any time when the vehicle was being driven on any of the following roads: Skipper's Canyon (Queenstown), Ninety Mile Beach (Northland), or any unformed roads and/or roads other than tarseal or metal; including but not limited to beaches, driveways, or any surface likely to damage the vehicle; or<br> r) at any time when the vehicle was operated beyond the term of the Rental Agreement or any agreed extension of the term,or at any other time or in any other circumstances notified by the owner to the hirer.</p>
<p><span class="head4">HIRER USES THEIR OWN INSURANCE</span><br> 23. If the hirer elects to use their own insurance, then the hirer accepts all liability for all losses, costs and damages set out in clause 15 (a) to (c), and agrees that clause 17 does not apply to such losses, costs and damages.</p>
<p><span class="head4">TRAFFIC OFFENCES</span><br> 24. All penalties related to traffic and/or parking offences are the responsibility of the hirer and the owner may charge the hirer's credit card for any traffic and/or parking offence infringement fees incurred by the hirer. The owner undertakes, in the event that the owner receives notice of any traffic or parking offenses incurred by the hirer, to send a copy of any such notice to the hirer as soon as is practicable and to provide the necessary information to the relevant issuing authority for such notices to be directed to the hirer. The hirer has the right to challenge, complain about, query or object to the alleged offence to the issuing enforcement authority and has a right to seek a court hearing (within 56 days from the date of issue of the infringement notice or 28 days from the date of issue of the reminder notice).</p>
<p>The owner may also charge an administration fee of $30 plus GST to cover the cost of processing and sending to the hirer notices related to traffic and/or parking infringements.</p>
<p><span class="head4">CANCELLATION OF HIRE AGREEMENT</span><br> 25. The owner has the right to terminate the hire and take immediate possession of the vehicle if the hirer fails to comply with any of the terms of the Rental Agreement, or if the vehicle is damaged. The termination of a hire under the authority of this clause shall be without prejudice to the other rights of the owner and the rights of the hirer under the Rental Agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="head4">GPS</span><br> 26. The hirer acknowledges that they are liable for:<br> (a) damage to or loss, including theft, of the GPS unit and/or its accessories.&nbsp; The charge is $200 plus GST per unit; and<br> (b) a handling and freight fee where any GPS accessory is damaged and/or not returned&nbsp; with the GPS unit. The charge is $30 plus GST per rental.</p>
<p><span class="head4">OPTIONAL COVERAGES <br></span>In addition to the insurance cover set out above, the hirer may also choose the Personal Accident Insurance (PAI) and/or Personal Effects and Baggage Insurance (PEB) and/or Excess Reduction (ER) options by so indicating on the Rental Document. PAI and PEB insurance is offered on behalf of the current policy underwriter, and the owner acts only as their agent in arranging this insurance. The amount of that excess and the daily rate payable in respect of ER is dependent upon the age of the hirer, the type of vehicle hired, and the location of hire.</p>
<p>The hirer acknowledges that the underwriter of, and/or the terms of, and/or the charges payable for PAI, PEB or ER may change without notice to the hirer; or the availability of the PAI, PEB or ER options may be cancelled without notice to the hirer.</p>
<p><span class="head4">PRIVACY ACT</span><br> The information requested from the hirer is to enable the owner to assess the hirer’s request to hire a vehicle.&nbsp; The hirer does not have to supply this information, but if the hirer does not, then the owner is unable to hire the vehicle. The hirer acknowledges that the owner will collect, hold and use the hirer’s personal information for purposes related to the hire of the vehicle and the provision of related customer services, including direct marketing and assessing customer satisfaction with products and services provided by the owner. The hirer further acknowledges that such personal information may be disclosed to debt collection agencies in the event that the hirer defaults in the payment of any monies owing to the owner, or other parties involved in an accident with the vehicle while on hire to the hirer; or any organisations responsible for the processing or handling of traffic related infringements; and the hirer hereby authorises the disclosure of their personal information for such purposes.</p>
<p><span class="head4">NOTE TO HIRER</span><br> NOTE - THE OWNER MUST GIVE THE HIRER AT LEAST ONE COPY OF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT WHICH MUST BE KEPT IN THE VEHICLE THROUGHOUT THE TERM OF THE HIRE AND PRODUCED ON DEMAND TO AN ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.</p>
